The way I have this configured (which is not necessarily the way you will use it) is
to setup apache2 as a reverse proxy to the dws webserver.

For these instructions I assume postgres is running, dws is running, and the minimal
dataset (not necessarily including sample data) is loaded into the database.

To do this:

1) Enable the proxying modules in apache. You can do this with this command:
	a2enmod proxy_http
2) Add another DNS name to the host running apache and dws. This name will be used
	only for dws. For my site I initially picked blog4.dachte.org
3) Install a proxying configfile telling apache to reverse proxy all incoming requests
	for that site to localhost:8000 (or whatever port you picked). A sample config
	for this is included in this directory; depending on what your Linux vendor
	did in terms of Apache paths, there's some variance in where this should go,
	but on Debian it should be placed in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/001-dws.conf
	You will want to customise this for whatever hostname you picked.
4) Restart apache and with any luck, visiting the hostname will take you to your DWS
	install.
5) Go enjoy a nice cup of tea before you start blogging or reviewing things.
