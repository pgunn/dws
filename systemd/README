You can run dws from systemd. This directory contains files designed to make that easier.
Remember that dws depeneds on postgres; it should not start up before postgres because it
will fail if it does.

* dws.service is the main unitfile for dws; it should probably be installed as
	/etc/systemd/system/dws.service

* dws-env.conf is a configfile for dws that sets environment variables for it to run.
	See the main DWS docs for info on what goes in there. It should probably be installed as
	/run/dws/dws-env.conf

* dws-syslog.conf is a syslog config for dws that will tell syslog to log its output to
	reasonable configs. It should probably be installed as
	/etc/rsyslog.d/dws-syslog.conf

You should look over these configs and customise them as you like.
