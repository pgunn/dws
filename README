DWS (dachte web services) is software designed to act as a blog and review
engine for my website. You can install and use it too.

Installation
------------
DWS is a standalone webserver that you should configure your existing
webserver to proxy some traffic to. It's designed to be container-friendly
and is significantly configured with environment variables


It runs on a high port, 8000 by default but configurable with the DWS_PORT
environment variable.

It uses Postgres to store its data. Configure your postgres for password
authentication, load the tables needed for the app (in the sql/ directory),
create an account with the ability to read from those tables, and
configure your launching environment to expose the username, password, and
database for the app in the environment variables:
	DWS_USER
	DWS_PASS
	DWS_DB

Status
------
This code does not come even close to doing its intended purpose yet. I'm
putting it up way early so others can follow along as I turn it into something
functional.
