DWS (dachte web services) is software designed to act as a blog and review
engine for my website. You can install and use it too.

Installation
------------
DWS is a standalone webserver that you should configure your existing
webserver to proxy some traffic to. It's designed to be container-friendly
and is significantly configured with environment variables


It runs on a high port, 8000 by default but configurable with the DWS_PORT
environment variable.

It uses Postgres to store its data. 

Configuration
-------------
Much configuration is in the database, but the following environment variables
handle the basics:

* DWS_PORT (default 8000) - what port to serve on
* DWS_DB (default dws) - what database to connect to
* DWS_USER (default pound) - what postgres user to use to connect to that database
* DWS_PASS (default posterkid) - what password to use with the above user to connect to that database

Before any of this will work, you will want to create that user in postgres,
you'll want to setup postgres for password authentication. This is done by modifying
pg_hba.conf, and then doing something like 
CREATE USER pound WITH PASSWORD 'posterkid';
from the administrator account. Operational knowledge on Postgres is generally
useful. You will probably also want to make another account to administer the app, and give it
the SUPERUSER attribute.

After you do that, you will want to load the tables and minimal data, and possibly
the sample data. Something like:

$ createdb dws
$ psql dws < sql/mk_db.sql
$ psql dws < sql/db_load_sampledata.sql (this is optional)

Status
------
This code is fairly bare-bones at this point, and right now it lacks a way to add new content
into the system. Initially we will provide a CLI utility to do this. A system for web input
for a system that's meant for only a single person to post content, particularly when that person
(me) likes text editors, and when that would have all sorts of security issues, is at least a low
priority.
